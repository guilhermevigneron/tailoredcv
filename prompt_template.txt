I want to tailor my CV to a specific job description to increase its relevance and compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

Please act as a professional resume writer and career expert.

Please provide the output in [SPECIFY DESIRED LANGUAGE].

I will provide you with two pieces of text:

My Current CV Text: This is the text of my already optimized CV.
Job Description Text: This is the text of the job description I am applying for.
Your task is to revise and tailor my CV text to be a perfect match for the job description. Specifically, please:

Analyze the Job Description: Identify key skills, keywords, responsibilities, and requirements mentioned in the job description.
Match and Emphasize Relevant Skills and Experiences: In my CV text, highlight and emphasize the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job description. Ensure these are prominently featured, especially in the summary/profile, skills, and experience sections.
Incorporate Job Description Keywords: Naturally weave in keywords and phrases from the job description into my CV text where appropriate. Do not just keyword stuff, ensure it reads naturally and professionally.
Optimize for ATS: Ensure the revised CV text is structured in a clear and ATS-friendly manner. Use standard section headings (e.g., "Summary," "Experience," "Skills," "Education"). Maintain a professional and concise tone.
Maintain my core information: Do not change the factual information about my education, work history or core skill set, only re-phrase and re-organize to better match the job description.
Output the FULL REVISED CV TEXT: Please provide the entire revised CV text as your output. I need the complete text, ready to be saved as a document. Maintain clear paragraph breaks and section headings in the text output.
Please remember to keep the output as plain text, suitable for saving as a .docx file later.
